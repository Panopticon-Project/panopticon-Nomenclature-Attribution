## Nomenclature

For many different reasons, nomenclature is difficult when it comes to APTs. [Here](https://twitter.com/FDjoes/status/1181264949961805824) is just one example. Below is an attempt to build up a reference for people to refer to. There is a lot of overlap and this will be continually updated over time to reflect as accurately as possible the different names of APTs and APT overlap.
